  cd fairseq
  pip install --editable ./
  ```

## Quick Start

- First you need to choose your task.

- After that reload the train_step of your chosen task according to the code we provided.

- Finally tweak your criterion to make sure it returns a list with the losses of multiple tasks.

  It's easy enough for you to execute as you want without any problems!
